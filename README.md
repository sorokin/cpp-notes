# How to get started

To build the notes the following programs need to be installed:
* latex
* minted
* pygments

To download and build the notes execute the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sorokin/cpp-notes.git
$ cd cpp-notes
$ make
```

After executing these commands two files will be build:
* main.pdf &mdash; the notes itself
* how-to-contribute.pdf &mdash; a detailed contributor guide

For more details, please refer to how-to-contribute.pdf.
